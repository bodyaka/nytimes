# nytimes project

Project is based at NodeJS server

NYTynes API is proxied by NodeJS. (In first variant of project was used JSONP for Cross-Domain request, but in API-V2 full text of article is not returned. Then i'm try to use API-V1 for get full text, but as it turned out V1 is completely deprecated)

##Install:
